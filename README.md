The image shows the stimuli used in our novel temporal integration task. 
The stimulus consist of the image of a horizontal sine wave, modified vertically by contrast. 
On each frame the image is recreated and random noise is added. 
The task requires the merging of consecutive frames presented in rapid succession, allowing to cancel the noise and perceive a coherent sine wave. 
Repetition allows participants to see the pattern at lower stimulus contrast levels (vertically). 

Frames duration varies for the 5 stimuli shown from left to right as indicated in the bottom.
It's easily noticeable how the sine wave pattern can be detected withouth effort in the top part of the image. While it's harder to recognize in the top part of the static condition.
